Adapter display needs to be more robust, because sometimes it shows the non-monitor mode adapter. Example: both wlan1 and wlan1mon when it should only show wlan1mon

When selecting channels, the previously selected channels show which is correct, but it always defaults to 200 ms even if last time had a different selection like 10 sec.

Filename prefix should be filename suffix, as it comes after the date. Also, trailing underscore after adapter name should be removed.

If only one adapter is availble to capture on, then multi-adapter capture section should not appear at all.
