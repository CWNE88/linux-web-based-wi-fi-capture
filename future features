This capture utility should be kept as simple and straight forward as possible, and focus purely on easily doing Wi-Fi packet captures.

There is some room for minimal extra features.

There will be options to capture only specific types of traffic, like management, control, or data frames (or any combination of them).

There can be some specific sub-types too, like beacons, association, probe, EAPOL. This can be very useful when trying to capture clients joining a network, without having to capture everything else in the air and creating excessively large capture files.
